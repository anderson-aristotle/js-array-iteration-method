## Delivery Notes

### Framing
- Introduce the talk, framing how this will be difficult. The developer does not need to understand the inner workings right now. They simply need to know how to use the tool. How to use the drill to screw in a nail, not the inner workings of the drill.

### Callbacks
 - Call various developers to repeat what a callback is, until it's an automatic response. 
 
### Array Functions
  - Give example of fat arrow function with implicit returned. Two ways to use: with `{}`, which in regard to return works same as other js functions. And without `{}`, which leads to implicit return.
  - Reinforce that a javascript function normally returns undefined unless you specify `return ...`

### Array Iteration Methods
